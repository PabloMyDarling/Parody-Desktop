# Parody-Desktop
A desktop made ENTIRELY with Tkinter Python.

## How to install it
This part of the README will teach you how to install this app.  

### Requirements

All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org). Since I made this app with built-in modules only, you don't need to download any modules alongside it.  

### Installing Parody Desktop itself

Follow the usual steps of downloading a repository (download the ZIP file, and extract it to a special folder).  




***Enjoy!***
