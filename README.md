# Parody-Desktop
A desktop made ENTIRELY with Tkinter Python.

## How to install it
This part of the README will teach you how to install this app.  

### Requirements

All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org) and ``keyboard``. Since I made this app with mostly built-in modules only, you don't need to download any other modules alongside it.  
To install the ``keyboard`` module, you need to go to your Shell and type in the following command:  

```
pip3 install keyboard
```
or
```
pip install keyboard
```

### Installing Parody Desktop itself

Follow the usual steps of downloading a repository (download the ZIP file, and extract it to a special folder).  




***Enjoy!***
